# Binary Classification of TP53 Gene Variants
## Project Overview

This machine learning project was developed as part of the final examination for the following Master's degree subjects at Singidunum University:

- **Data Science and Applied Artificial Intelligence**
- **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Engineering**
The work was conducted under the supervision of university professors.

## Key Achievements

- **97.5% recall* optimized to minimize false negatives in critical cancer risk classification

- Feature engineering from biological annotations and ClinVar data

- Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV

- Focus on the clinically critical minority class (pathogenic variants)



## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting



## Clinical Relevance

TP53 mutations are crucial in cancer development. Accurate classification helps in:

- Cancer risk assessment

- Clinical decision support

- Variant interpretation for precision oncology

## Data Availability

The raw ClinVar dataset used for data engineering and dataset organization in this project is available via Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Xdx273hzZ5Vwem8tFI56Wi2ByjIXFvC/view?usp=drive_link]
