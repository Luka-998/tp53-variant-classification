\# Binary Classification of TP53 Gene Variants



\## Project Overview



This machine learning project was developed as part of my Master's degree coursework at Singidunum University, under the supervision of university professors.



\*\*Relevant coursework:\*\* Data Science and Applied Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Engineering.



\## Key Achievements

\- \*\*97.5% recall\*\* optimized to minimize false negatives in critical cancer risk classification

\- Feature engineering from biological annotations and ClinVar data

\- Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV

\- Focus on the clinically critical minority class (pathogenic variants)



\## Models Implemented

\- Logistic Regression

\- Decision Tree

\- Random Forest

\- Gradient Boosting



\## Clinical Relevance

TP53 mutations are crucial in cancer development. Accurate classification helps in:

\- Cancer risk assessment

\- Clinical decision support

\- Variant interpretation for precision oncology
